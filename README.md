University of Maryland Alumni Association is looking for Longitudinal Impact Report:

Mission Statements:

1. To Identify variables that are correlated to our desired outcomes of higher event attendance of first time attendees and major gift prospect attendees.
2. By understanding these correlations, we hope to optimize both new and existing events in order to improve our strategy to engage alumni in these two groups.
3. Ultimately, we need assistance in understanding what types of events attract the largest number of first time attendees and major gift prospects so that we can use this information in planning future events.
